# Welcome to Distributed.ai

Thank you for your interest in Distributed.ai - a community-driven experiment exploring the use of AI for managing distributed ownership models.

## About the Project

Distributed.ai aims to create an equitable business model that prioritizes purpose, users, and employees before investors, using AI to ensure fair distribution of ownership and value. We're working to transform the traditional venture capital paradigm into a more inclusive and democratized ecosystem.

## Discussion Guidelines

To maintain a productive and inclusive environment, please:

1. **Be Respectful**: Treat all community members with courtesy and respect
2. **Stay On Topic**: Keep discussions relevant to Distributed.ai and its mission
3. **Provide Context**: When asking questions, include sufficient background information

## Governance
