# Distributed.ai

Welcome to the Distributed.ai project! We're experimenting with a new way to build businesses, where ownership is distributed fairly among everyone who contributes, using Artificial Intelligence to guide the process.

## üåü Mission and Vision

**Our Mission:** To create an equitable business model that prioritizes purpose, users, and employees before investors, using AI to ensure fair distribution of ownership and value.

**Our Vision:** A world where communities collaboratively bring innovative ideas to life, transforming the traditional venture capital paradigm into a more inclusive and democratized ecosystem.

## üí° The Core Concept

At the heart of Distributed.ai is a revolutionary idea: using a Large Language Model (LLM) to manage a distributed ownership model. We're building this as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

Our model includes:
- **Governance Tokens:** Contributors earn tokens that grant them voting rights.
- **Community Treasury:** A treasury, controlled by the token holders, will fund the project's development and initiatives.
- **DAO Proposals:** All major decisions, including the prompts that guide the AI, are made through community voting.

## üöÄ Current Status

This project is currently in the community-building phase. Our main goal is to see if this idea resonates with people like you. We are actively seeking feedback, ideas, and early contributors to help shape the future of this experiment.

The product itself is an open question. We are leaning towards a platform focused on personal data ownership, but this is a decision we want to make with the community.

## ü§ù Get Involved!

This is a community-driven experiment, and we need your help! As we grow, there will be many ways to contribute:
*   **Join the discussion:** Share your ideas and feedback on our foundational concepts.
*   **Work on Bounties:** Take on specific, rewarded tasks to help the project.
*   **Propose a Project:** Eventually, you will be able to apply for grants from the community treasury to build something new.
*   **Spread the word:** Tell your friends and colleagues about Distributed.ai!

You can find more details in our [Business Proposal](project_docs/business-proposal.md).

## ‚öñÔ∏è Disclaimer

Distributed.ai is an experiment. The concepts of LLM-based ownership and governance are novel and come with legal and technical challenges that we will need to solve together as a community.
