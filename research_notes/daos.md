# A Summary of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

## What is a DAO?
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a community-led entity managed via blockchain technology and smart contracts. This structure enables transparent, member-driven decision-making without centralized leadership.

## Prominent DAO Examples

DAOs have been successfully implemented across various sectors, most notably in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and the Metaverse.

### DeFi Protocols
- **MakerDAO (MKR):** A pioneer in DeFi, responsible for the DAI stablecoin. MKR holders vote on key parameters to maintain the stability of DAI.
- **Uniswap (UNI):** Governs the leading decentralized exchange. UNI holders vote on proposals, including the allocation of its substantial treasury.
- **Aave (AAVE):** Oversees a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. It uses Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs) for governance.
- **Curve (CRV):** Specializes in stablecoin trading. It uses a vote-escrowed (veCRV) model, where long-term token holders gain increased voting power, aligning incentives with the protocol's long-term health.

### Metaverse and Digital Worlds
- **Decentraland (MANA, LAND):** Governs the first user-owned virtual world. Holders of MANA (currency) and LAND (virtual real estate) vote on in-world policies and treasury allocation.

## Monetization and Contributor Compensation

Successful DAOs are not purely volunteer-driven. They have robust economic models to fund operations and compensate contributors.

### How DAOs Generate Revenue
- **Protocol Fees:** A small percentage taken from transactions (e.g., trading fees).
- **Token Sales:** Initial capital raised by selling native governance tokens.
- **Treasury Management:** Investing assets to earn yield.
- **NFT Sales & Royalties:** Revenue from primary sales and secondary market fees.

### How DAO Contributors Are Paid
- **Grants:** Treasury funds allocated to teams for specific projects.
- **Salaries and Stipends:** Regular payments for core contributors in ongoing roles.
- **Bounties:** Rewards for completing smaller, one-off tasks.
- **Retroactive Funding:** Rewarding individuals who have already provided significant value to the ecosystem.
- **Token Rewards:** Governance tokens are distributed for active participation, giving contributors a stake in the project's future success.

## Founder Rewards and Long-Term Alignment

Founders are rewarded for their initial vision and risk, primarily through a pre-defined allocation of the project's native tokens. To ensure long-term commitment, these tokens are subject to specific conditions.

- **Founder Allocation:** A percentage of the total token supply (e.g., 15-25%) is set aside for the founding team. This is typically disclosed publicly in the project's tokenomics.

- **Vesting Schedule:** Founder tokens are locked and released gradually over time, typically over 3-4 years. This incentivizes them to build the project for the long term.

- **The Cliff:** A period at the beginning of the vesting schedule (e.g., one year) where no tokens are unlocked. If a founder leaves before the cliff, they receive no tokens, protecting the project from being abandoned.

This model aligns founder incentives with the DAO's long-term health and builds trust within the community.
