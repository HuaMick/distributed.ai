# Distributed.ai - The Proposal

This plan outlines a community-driven experiment to validate using AI to manage a distributed ownership model. 

## 1. Mission and Vision

**Mission:** To create an equitable business model that prioritizes purpose, users, and employees before investors, using AI to ensure fair distribution of ownership and value.

**Vision:** A world where communities collaboratively bring innovative ideas to life, transforming the traditional venture capital paradigm into a more inclusive and democratized ecosystem.

## 2. Executive Summary

This project introduces a pioneering governance framework that stands at the intersection of decentralized community principles and the exponential advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs). While traditional Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have democratized decision-making, their effectiveness is often capped by subjective resource allocation, political dynamics, and an over-reliance on volatile crypto-assets for incentives. Our experiment is designed to solve these fundamental challenges.

The core of our model is a next-generation DAO that utilizes a continuously learning LLM as its primary "sense-making" engine. Recognizing that LLM capabilities are advancing every few months, our architecture is built to evolve, becoming progressively more nuanced and effective over time. Instead of relying on simplistic voting or token-holding metrics, the LLM will programmatically analyze the full spectrum of verifiable contributions. By ingesting and evaluating data directly from sources like Git repository commits, documentation updates, design contributions, and community support metrics, the LLM will generate objective, transparent, and equitable recommendations for ownership and reward distribution.

This data-driven approach allows us to transcend many of the inherent limitations of human-led governance. While all systems require oversight, an LLM governed by clear rules is significantly more impartial and less susceptible to the personal biases and political maneuvering that can undermine human committees. The initial phase of this project is focused on building a foundational community to validate this core concept. Through targeted engagement, we will gather critical feedback and, with sufficient community buy-in, commit resources to formalize the project's structure and technical roadmap, creating a truly meritocratic and effective decentralized organization.

## 3. Product and Value Proposition

The initial product strategy is an open question, designed to be answered collaboratively with the community. This ensures that our final direction aligns with our core principles and leverages the collective wisdom of our members. Several promising concepts have been identified as potential starting points:

- **A Platform for LLM-Powered DAOs:** We could create a foundational platform or template that empowers other entrepreneurs and communities to easily launch their own DAOs using an LLM for governance and reward distribution. This would position us as a key enabler in the next generation of decentralized organizations.
- **A Personal Data DAO:** In a world where personal data is controlled by a handful of large corporations, we could build a DAO that allows individuals to pool their data and collectively control its use. This would empower users to monetize their own data or contribute it to research initiatives that align with their values, rather than corporate interests.
- **Community-Owned AI Development Tools:** The AI landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, but it is heavily dominated by well-funded, for-profit companies. We could focus on creating open-source, community-developed AI tools. A DAO structure would allow these tools to be built and maintained without relying on traditional venture capital, ensuring that decisions are driven by community needs rather than investor demands.

## 4. Community Governance Model

Our governance model is detailed in a separate [Community Governance Plan](./governance.md).

## 5. Contributor, Founder, and Investor Rewards

To attract and retain talent, Distributed.ai will adopt proven compensation models from the Web3 ecosystem, ensuring all participants are rewarded fairly for their contributions.

- **For Contributors:**
    - **Grants:** Teams or individuals can propose projects to the DAO. If approved by the community, the treasury will release funds for development, research, or marketing campaigns.
    - **Bounties:** Smaller, specific tasks will be funded through bounties that any community member can complete to earn rewards.
    - **Token Rewards:** Active participation and valuable contributions will be rewarded with governance tokens, giving contributors a direct stake in the project's future success.
- **For Founders & Early Investors:**
    - **Token Allocation:** A pre-defined percentage of the total token supply will be allocated to founders and early investors to reward them for their initial vision, risk, and capital.
    - **Vesting Schedules:** To ensure long-term commitment, these allocations will be subject to a vesting schedule (e.g., a 4-year period with a 1-year cliff). This standard practice protects the community by aligning the founding team's incentives with the project's long-term health.

## 6. Open questions and challenges to 

The experimental nature of this venture means that many components will be developed collaboratively with the community. Key open questions include:

- **Formal Legal Structure:** Establishing a legal framework for the DAO to ensure regulatory compliance, particularly concerning securities laws.
- **Detailed LLM Governance:** Designing the specific mechanisms for how the community will collaboratively propose, test, and implement the LLM's prompts, along with technical safeguards against bias and manipulation.
- **Specifics of the Governance Model:** Creating a comprehensive governance model that defines voting thresholds, dispute resolution processes, and the overall decision-making lifecycle.
- **Long-Term Product Monetization:** Choosing and developing a viable, ethical, and legally sound product. The initial concept of a personal data platform requires navigating significant privacy laws and ethical considerations, which the community must address.
