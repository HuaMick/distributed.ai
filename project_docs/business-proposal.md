# Distributed.ai - The Proposal

This plan outlines a community-driven experiment to validate using AI to manage a distributed ownership model. 

## 1. Mission and Vision

**Mission:** To create an equitable business model that prioritizes purpose, users, and employees before investors, using AI to ensure fair distribution of ownership and value.

**Vision:** A world where communities collaboratively bring innovative ideas to life, transforming the traditional venture capital paradigm into a more inclusive and democratized ecosystem.

## 2. Executive Summary

This project is an experiment to determine the viability of a more equitable, distributed ownership model managed by Large Language Models (LLMs). The core premise is to leverage an LLM to dynamically and fairly distribute ownership, profits, or both among all project contributors.

The initial phase is focused on building a community to validate this core concept. We will engage with online communities to gather feedback and gauge interest. Sufficient community engagement will unlock further resource commitment to formalize the project's structure and roadmap.

## 3. Product and Value Proposition

The initial product strategy is an open question, designed to be answered collaboratively with the community to ensure alignment with the model's principles. A leading concept is a platform that empowers users with greater ownership and control over their personal data, ensuring it is leveraged for their benefit rather than for corporate interests. This approach directly reflects the project's mission.

## 4. Community Governance Model

The proposed governance model is centered on community control over the LLM. Participants will be empowered to vote on the core prompts submitted to the AI, which will, in turn, define the parameters for equitable distribution based on contributions. This voting system will require a sophisticated architecture with robust safeguards to mitigate risks such as prompt manipulation and ensure its integrity.

## 5. Other Key Areas to be Fleshed Out

The experimental nature of this venture means that many standard business components will be developed collaboratively with the community once the core idea has demonstrated sufficient appeal. These areas include:

- **Formal Legal Structure:** A detailed legal framework for the company and the novel, fluid ownership structure will need to be established to ensure regulatory compliance, particularly concerning securities laws.

- **LLM Governance:** The specific mechanisms for how the community will collaboratively edit the LLM's prompts, along with safeguards against manipulation, bias, and other technical and ethical challenges, need to be designed.

- **Detailed Governance Model:** A comprehensive governance model that goes beyond prompt-editing will need to be created to address dispute resolution, voting rights, and the overall decision-making process.

- **Compliant Reward Structure:** The initial multi-level marketing approach for user acquisition will need to be refined into a sustainable and legally compliant referral program that does not violate laws against pyramid schemes.

- **Long-Term Product Monetization:** A viable, ethical, and legally sound product will need to be chosen and developed. The initial idea of monetizing user personal data requires navigating significant privacy laws and ethical considerations.

- **Investor Relations:** If external investment is sought, a framework will be needed to accommodate investors whose expectations of fixed equity may conflict with the dynamic, LLM-driven model.
