# Distributed.ai - The Proposal

This plan outlines a community-driven experiment to validate using AI to manage a distributed ownership model. 

## 1. Mission and Vision

**Mission:** To create an equitable business model that prioritizes purpose, users, and employees before investors, using AI to ensure fair distribution of ownership and value.

**Vision:** A world where communities collaboratively bring innovative ideas to life, transforming the traditional venture capital paradigm into a more inclusive and democratized ecosystem.

## 2. Executive Summary

This project is an experiment to determine the viability of a more equitable, distributed ownership model managed by Large Language Models (LLMs). The core premise is to leverage an LLM to dynamically and fairly distribute ownership, profits, or both among all project contributors.

The initial phase is focused on building a community to validate this core concept. We will engage with online communities to gather feedback and gauge interest. Sufficient community engagement will unlock further resource commitment to formalize the project's structure and roadmap.

## 3. Product and Value Proposition

The initial product strategy is an open question, designed to be answered collaboratively with the community to ensure alignment with the model's principles. A leading concept is a platform that empowers users with greater ownership and control over their personal data, ensuring it is leveraged for their benefit rather than for corporate interests. This approach directly reflects the project's mission.

## 4. Community Governance Model

Inspired by successful Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), our proposed governance model is centered on community control, managed through a native governance token.

- **Governance Tokens:** A dedicated token will be distributed to contributors, granting them voting rights on key project decisions. This ensures that the most active and invested members have a proportional say in the project's direction.
- **Community Treasury:** The project will maintain a treasury, funded through mechanisms to be decided by the community (e.g., protocol fees, token sales). These funds will be used to finance development, reward contributors, and grow the ecosystem, with all spending approved by token holders.
- **Proposal System:** All major decisions, from roadmap changes to treasury spending, will be executed through a formal proposal system (akin to Aave's AIPs). This includes voting on the core prompts submitted to the LLM for equity distribution, ensuring the process is democratic and transparent.
- **Mitigating Manipulation:** The voting system will incorporate mechanisms to mitigate risks like prompt manipulation or voter apathy. Models like the vote-escrowed (ve) system used by Curve DAO, which rewards long-term token holders with greater voting power, will be explored to ensure stability.

## 5. Contributor, Founder, and Investor Rewards

To attract and retain talent, Distributed.ai will adopt proven compensation models from the Web3 ecosystem, ensuring all participants are rewarded fairly for their contributions.

- **For Contributors:**
    - **Grants:** Teams or individuals can propose projects to the DAO. If approved by the community, the treasury will release funds for development, research, or marketing campaigns.
    - **Bounties:** Smaller, specific tasks will be funded through bounties that any community member can complete to earn rewards.
    - **Token Rewards:** Active participation and valuable contributions will be rewarded with governance tokens, giving contributors a direct stake in the project's future success.
- **For Founders & Early Investors:**
    - **Token Allocation:** A pre-defined percentage of the total token supply will be allocated to founders and early investors to reward them for their initial vision, risk, and capital.
    - **Vesting Schedules:** To ensure long-term commitment, these allocations will be subject to a vesting schedule (e.g., a 4-year period with a 1-year cliff). This standard practice protects the community by aligning the founding team's incentives with the project's long-term health.

## 6. Key Areas for Collaborative Development

The experimental nature of this venture means that many components will be developed collaboratively with the community. Key open questions include:

- **Formal Legal Structure:** Establishing a legal framework for the DAO to ensure regulatory compliance, particularly concerning securities laws.
- **Detailed LLM Governance:** Designing the specific mechanisms for how the community will collaboratively propose, test, and implement the LLM's prompts, along with technical safeguards against bias and manipulation.
- **Specifics of the Governance Model:** Creating a comprehensive governance model that defines voting thresholds, dispute resolution processes, and the overall decision-making lifecycle.
- **Long-Term Product Monetization:** Choosing and developing a viable, ethical, and legally sound product. The initial concept of a personal data platform requires navigating significant privacy laws and ethical considerations, which the community must address.
