# Community Governance Model

This section is under active discussion. We are considering several models for project governance and contributor recognition. The central question is whether to implement a token-based system for voting and rewards. Below are the two primary proposals being considered.

## Proposal 1: Token-Based Governance

This model uses a dedicated governance token to manage the project, inspired by successful Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

- **Token Distribution:** An LLM will be tasked with analyzing contributions and distributing governance tokens accordingly. This ensures that rewards are proportional to an individual's impact as interpreted by the AI.
- **Voting Power:** Token holders have voting rights on key project decisions, including roadmap changes, treasury spending, and modifications to the governance model itself.
- **Community Treasury:** A treasury, funded by mechanisms decided by the community, would be controlled by token holders.
- **Stability Mechanisms:** To ensure long-term stability and mitigate manipulation, we would explore models like the vote-escrowed (ve) system, which grants more voting power to long-term token holders.

## Proposal 2: Reputation-Based Governance (Non-Token)

This model operates without a native token, focusing instead on a reputation system powered by an LLM.

- **Recognition System:** The LLM will analyze aggregated data and metrics from across the project (e.g., code commits, documentation, community support) to assign reputation scores to contributors.
- **Community-Guided Prompt:** The community will collaboratively create and vote on a "master prompt" that guides the LLM's analysis. This ensures the evaluation criteria align with the community's values.
- **Decision Making:** A formal proposal system will be used for all major decisions. Influence in this system could be based on reputation scores, ensuring that experienced and trusted contributors have a stronger voice.
