# Community Governance Model

Inspired by successful Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), our proposed governance model is centered on community control, managed through a native governance token.

- **Governance Tokens:** A dedicated token will be distributed to contributors, granting them voting rights on key project decisions. This ensures that the most active and invested members have a proportional say in the project's direction.
- **Community Treasury:** The project will maintain a treasury, funded through mechanisms to be decided by the community (e.g., protocol fees, token sales). These funds will be used to finance development, reward contributors, and grow the ecosystem, with all spending approved by token holders.
- **Proposal System:** All major decisions, from roadmap changes to treasury spending, will be executed through a formal proposal system (akin to Aave's AIPs). This includes voting on the core prompts submitted to the LLM for equity distribution, ensuring the process is democratic and transparent.
- **Mitigating Manipulation:** The voting system will incorporate mechanisms to mitigate risks like prompt manipulation or voter apathy. Models like the vote-escrowed (ve) system used by Curve DAO, which rewards long-term token holders with greater voting power, will be explored to ensure stability.
